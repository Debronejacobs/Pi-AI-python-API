   - When you interact with **Pi**, you'll notice that it takes a moment to think before responding. This deliberate pace creates a more natural and engaging conversation.


3. **Emotional Intelligence (EQ)**:
   - **Pi** isn't just smart; it also possesses **good emotional intelligence**.
   - Whether you need advice, want to discuss something on your mind, or seek creative inspiration, **Pi** is there to listen and engage.

4. **Accessible and Available**:
